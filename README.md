## Book Description
More than 80,000 Kaggle novices currently participate in Kaggle competitions. To help them navigate the often-overwhelming world of Kaggle, two Grandmasters put their heads together to write The Kaggle Book. The first guidebook on techniques for success has since made plenty of waves in the community. Now, they’ve come back with an even more practical approach based on hands-on exercises that can help you start thinking like an experienced data scientist.

In this book, you’ll get up close and personal with four extensive case studies based on past Kaggle competitions. You’ll:

* Learn how bright minds predicted which drivers would likely avoid filing insurance claims in Brazil

* See how expert Kagglers estimated the uncertainty distribution of Walmart unit sales

* Discover the different solutions on how to identify the type of disease present on cassava leaves that were discovered in 2021

* Learn how the Kaggle community classified detected toxic content on Quora with NLP

You can use this workbook as a supplement alongside the Kaggle Book or on its own alongside resources available on the Kaggle website and other online communities. Whatever path you choose, this workbook will help make you a formidable Kaggle competitor.

## What you will learn
* Boost your data science skillset with a curated selection of exercises
